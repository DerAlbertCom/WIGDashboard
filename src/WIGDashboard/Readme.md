WIG Dashboard
==========

A little internal tool which show and collection some inventory and a dashboard with information.

Far from finished, just sarted. Also this project should be a playground for me to
try some new things, frameworks, and technology.

It should work on the latest browsers, but the goal
is to get it run also with IE 8+.

Technology i like to use here
=======

* ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET WebAPI
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap from Twitter
* SignalR
